On this page, MotaLee will introduce some basic knowledge about LLIE and machine learning, and attach some notes recorded on papers in this field. At the same time, he will update some ideas from time to time, as well as the problems he encountered while writing papers.  
Maybe I should integrate all my ideas and put them into a collection based on different basicmodels? HaH:)
